<h2> The Story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer
    said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
    everybody
    came back and said, <q class="villager">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again
    said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q></p>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
    neighbors then said, <q class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too
    <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>
        ,”</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q> The next day the
    conscription
    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again
    all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q></p>
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is
    <tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    or
    <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>
    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
    <tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    fortune.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>a
<p>
   <q><tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    and
    <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>
    are just one perspective. Bananas are
    <tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    for monkeys, but monkeys are not
    <tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</q>
